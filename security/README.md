# Goa Security Examples

The security examples illustrate how to secure Goa service endpoints using the
built-in constructs. There are two examples illustrating two different aspects:

* The [hierachy](hierarchy/) example shows how to apply security schemes at the
  API, service and single method levels.
* The [multiauth](multiauth/) example shows how to leverage different security
  schemes to secure endpoints.
