[![Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-gophers-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/goa/)

This repository contains examples of microservices implemented using
[Goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa). Each example focuses on a specific topic as indicated by
the directory name. The [cellar](https://github.com/goadesign/examples/tree/master/cellar) example
provides a complete implementation of a simple microservice.

A [fully instrumented example](https://github.com/goadesign/clue/tree/main/example/weather) of a
system consisting of multiple Goa microservices is included in the
[Clue](https://github.com/goadesign/clue) repo.

As you study each example consider contributing back by providing better or more complete docs,
adding clarifying comments to code or fixing any error you may run across!
